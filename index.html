			So, we'll go no more a roving 
   			So late into the night, 
			Though the heart be still as loving, 
  			And the moon be still as bright. 
  			</span>

			<p class="center" id= underline> 
			For the sword outwears its sheath, 
   			And the soul wears out the breast, 
			And the heart must pause to breathe, 
   			And love itself have rest. 
			</p>
			
			<p class="space-out" id=capitalize> 
			Though the night was made for loving, 
  			And the day returns too soon, 
			Yet we'll go no more a roving 
   			By the light of the moon.
