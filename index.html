<h1 id=line-through> Lord Byron </h1>

<p class="space-out" id=capitalize> 
<span id="green">
So, we'll go no more a roving 
   	So late into the night, 
Though the heart be still as loving, 
  And the moon be still as bright. 
  </span>
</p>

<p class="center" id= underline> 
For the sword outwears its sheath, 
   	And the soul wears out the breast, 
And the heart must pause to breathe, 
   	And love itself have rest. 
</p>
<p class="space-out" id=capitalize> 
Though the night was made for loving, 
  And the day returns too soon, 
Yet we'll go no more a roving 
   	By the light of the moon.
